Forest fires are a serious environmental problem that can cause damage to ecosystems, wildlife, and human lives. To prevent and mitigate the impact of forest fires, it is important to be able to predict the occurrence and spread of fire based on various factors. In this project, we use machine learning to develop a forest fire prediction model based on three features: temperature, humidity, and oxygen percentage. We use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which is a simple and effective method for classification and regression problems. KNN works by finding the k most similar instances in the training data and assigning the label or value based on the majority vote or average of the neighbors.
