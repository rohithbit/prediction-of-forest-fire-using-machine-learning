A new forest fire risk prediction system, based on support vector machines and historical weather data, has been developed. This approach aims to accurately forecast days with a high risk of forest fires. By analyzing past patterns, the system helps prioritize prevention efforts and resource allocation for forest guards. The proactive strategy aids in minimizing damage and expediting recovery efforts in affected areas. Continuous refinement and integration of real-time data are crucial for maintaining the system's effectiveness over time.
